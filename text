Soo...#{@name}. You arrive one Friday morning in mid October. The air is crisp on your skin. You fumble with your phone to open the J ST. single door and wait for Kisi to load. After what seems like an eternity, you are finally granted access. You enter the Hopper classroom when something seems wrong.

You swing open the heavy Hopper door to find #{victim} dead on the floor.

You see something lying next to 's lifeless corpse. What is it?

In a state of shock you decide to...

(This is the SCREAM option)

  #{@name} screams. Upon hearing the blood-curdling scream, he runs out of the room.

  "What happened!? What's wrong!? Who ded!?" #{@murderer1} yells walking up to him.
  #{@name} then explains what he found to #{@murderer1}.

  (Weapon list one)

      #{@name} thinks #{@murderer1} seems rather suspicious.

      "What were you doing here so early?" #{@name} asks.

      "I...I... had to..um.. change the kombucha keg." #{@murderer1} stutters.

      Do you believe her?

      (This is option NO)

      End game. #{@murderer1} killed you.

      (This is option YES)

      "Oh, finally! The kombucha keg has been empty all week!" #{@name} stated. "Let's find out who could've done this."

      #{@name} and #{@murderer1} go back in the room and begin to look around for more clues. They followed a set of bloody footprints leading to the bathroom.

      Do you want to go into the bathroom?

      (This is option NO bathroom)

      End game. #{@murderer1} stabs you from behind.

      (This is option YES bathroom)

      End game. #{@murderer1} shoves your head in the toilet and gives you a swirly. You're dead.

  (Weapon list two)

      #{@murderer1} says that she saw someone come out of the Hopper classroom earlier that morning holding {weapon}.

      "Who was it?" #{@name} asks.

      "I could tell you... for a price..." #{@murderer1} replies. "I want $14,000 with a $500 non-refundable deposit."

      Do you pay up?

      (Option NO)

      #{@murderer1} kills you. You ded.

      (Option YES)

      #{@name} hands over his life savings to #{@murderer1}. She takes your money and runs.

      You are left alive, but broke. Game over.

  (Weapon list three)

      "What are you talking about? The LEARN academy is the safest place on earth," #{@murderer1} says.

      They both go into the classroom, and to #{@name}'s shock the body and the murder weapon are missing!

      What do you do?

      (Option FUGGET about it)

      (do same thing as learn challenges)

      (Option insist that you saw something)

      "I know that I saw #{victim}'s dead body here next to {weapon}!" cried #{@name}. "It was right here in front of the white board!"

      "You crazy," says #{@murderer1}. "I haven't seen anyone here all morning, except for #{murderer2}."

      "#{murderer2}?" #{@name} thinks to himself. "He loves {weapon}!"

      "It had to have been #{murderer2}!" #{@name} tells #{@murderer1}. "He loves {weapon}!"

      The two begin searching for him, but their search brings them to the staircase.

      What do you want to do?

      (Go Upstairs)

      #{murderer2} was waiting for you. You ded.

      (Option FUGGET about it)

      (do same thing as learn challenges)


(This is the LEARN option)

  #{@name} goes to his station to pull up the LEARN site. The challenge for the day is to perform a math function of 1+2 in Ruby.

  Can you add 1 + 2 in Ruby? Y/N

  (OPTION YES)
    irb: 1 + 2 = {1+2}

    Good job, #{@name}!

    #{@name} decides to do the stretch goal. He starts to read it aloud:

    "I have buttons but I’m not a shirt,
    I have doors but I’m not a house,
    I go up and down but I’m not an umbrella,
    I need at least two stories but I’m not a book of fairytales,
    I’m found in tall buildings but I’m not a penthouse."

    What am I?

    (NO MATTER ANS)

    It's the elevator challenge. You die from a migraine.

  (OPTION NO)
    Math has killed you. You ded.
